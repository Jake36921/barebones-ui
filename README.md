# barebones-ui
Quite literally a barebones ui made using kivy that allows you to chat, save, load, and clear chat history when connected to the oobabooga text gen api.

Completely made by an amataur at coding in python

Great for devices connected to the same network connected to a ai server(?) without getting confused or misstapping from too many things in different webuis

or your friends wanting to try using an ai at your place without getting too confused on what to do

or just want a clean ui

The Api url is inside main.py, change it to your oobabooga openai api

>pip install -r requirements.txt

---
>python main.py


>to do list

check if api is online

better ui

ability to change api in menu

exe file

prob more
