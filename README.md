# barebones-webui
Quite literally a barebones ui made using kivy that allows you to save, load, and clear chat history when connected to the oobabooga text gen api.
Great for devices connected to the same network connected to a ai server(?) without getting confused or misstapping from too many things in different webuis
or just want a clean ui
