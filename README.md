# barebones-webui
Quite literally a barebones ui made using kivy that allows you to save, load, and clear chat history when connected to the oobabooga text gen api.
Great for devices connected to the same network connected to a ai server(?) without need to install oobabooga  or worrying about the gradio link expiring
or just want a clean ui
